    <meta name="description" content="The NSGI’s goal is to train youth in responsible citizenship, character development, and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of outdoor activities, educational programs and at older age levels, career-oriented programs in partnership with community organizations. For young members, the Scout method is part of the program to instill typical Scouting values such as trustworthiness, good citizenship and outdoors skills, through a variety of activities such as camping, aquatics, and hiking.
Scouts develop skills including teamwork, time management, leadership, initiative, planning, communication, self-motivation, cultural awareness and commitment. We help young people to get jobs, save lives and even change the world."/>
